# COMP240---CPD
Week One 
This was the first week of the new semester for our first lecture we had Ed and his module is on Artificial intelligence. This is the topic I am looking forward to the most as this is something I am hopefully looking at specialising in. The first lecture just looked at what is AI and what AI can be applied to and what it has been applied to in the past.
The next two lectures were with Gareth and dealt with networking and the business side of video games. The first of the two lectures were on Distributed systems, for this lecture we looked at socket programming which looks quite confusing, so I will have to read more about this in my spare time. 
The second lecture we had was on the business side of the video games industry this was not new to me as I have already done work on businesses before. 
For the team game we all came back with new motivation for the game, so we brainstormed what we would need to have in the game to make it more fun and arranged some playtests. Myself and Jonny decided to integrate the AI component into out group game mine being a “Story Mode”, I found a tutorial online which did this using a weighting system while Ed told me look at behaviour machine, so I will be testing which one would be easier over the next week or so.
Week Two 
This session was on several types of AI architectures exist and what ones would be best for our AI components. I found this all very interesting and feel motivated to do this work I just do not how to do it. So, I will need to brush up my knowledge on how to do AI in unity which the game engine that we are using for our group game.
This lesson we looked at MUD and SUD which seemed quite interesting, but I am not very good with information being piled on top of me like they are for this module which is why I had a problem with Open GL last semester. I do not how I can overcome this and will need to ask for some help on it.
For the business lecture we looked at the business canvas which is all things that I did a while ago for A levels, so I am not feeling too stressed about this module as much as I am for the other ones.
Week Three
This session we looked at finite state machines and behaviour trees, this is what I want to do for my AI game component and I am finding it difficult to do now so I’m hoping to look over the slides will help me. Ed has recommended Behaviour Machine which should be easier than scripting the functions from scratch.
This session we looked at threading for our MUDS, so we can support multiple clients, this does not seem too difficult, but I can feel myself finding this the same as Open GL and leaving it to the last minute.
This week we looked at the business canvas and financial modelling which I always hate just because it is a large amount of numbers, but it turned out to not be too hard.
Week Four
This session we learned about security of using networks which was quite interesting, and I learned quite a bit about how easy it is to get into a network. Again, I have left the MUD.
This session we looked at minimax search which would help with such games as connect four but not much else anything more sophisticated than that.
This session we looked at the proposal for out business proposals which again does not seem too difficult as I did this for A levels but finding the information will be tedious.

Week Five 
This week we looked at the Monte Carlo tree search and how it can be used in games and did a peer review for the AI game components. While Monte Carlo is interesting I don’t see myself using it for this component but maybe for something in the future I will try it and see how it works.
This session we had a peer review for our MUDS which I found incredibly difficult so far which is my fault for not looking too into it but the deadlines from everything else has made me have to push this to the back.
For this session we looked at how to present effectively which was needed information as I cannot present very well.
Week Six
This week was spent trying to catch up on some of the assignments I let myself get behind on. I looked at the MUD again and could not do it still I feel like this is one assignment I am going to have to do at the end and rush because I cannot take the time to learn this while I have other deadlines approaching and the team game looming over me.
Week Seven
For this session we presented out business cases which was not too bad, but I had not read the brief and put the wrong info into my slides, so I had to do it again with the correct information.
For this session we looked at security for our muds and networking in general topping up what we learnt a few sessions ago. Which seemed quite fun, but I still have not updated my MUD far enough to apply this to it.
For this session we looked at pathfinding we looked at the A* pathfinding algorithm and how it can be applied to our Micro RTS bots,
Week Eight
This week we looked at each other’s business case studies, many people had not done much so far so there was not much to look at.
This session we looked at evolutionary algorithms which I have been wanting to look at for a while as I find this topic very interesting due to the game of life. 
This week we looked at implementing the databases for our MUDS which seemed quite daunting as I do not like this topic as it is a lot of information being thrown at you at once and I can’t keep up with the demands of the other modules plus this one.
Week Nine
This week was mostly spent trying to do some work for the group game and Ed’s work I have resigned myself to leaving the Distributing task till the last minute, but I don’t retain any information if I just try to force it.
Week Ten
This week was mostly spent trying to get work done for the distributing and AI work, The AI being the easier of the two. I am still lost on the distributing task completely.
Week Eleven 
This week was spent finishing p for the group game and trying to finish off some other assignments such as the AI Bot and the component. The AI component was a lot easier than the bot now but I’m hoping to have a more extensive look at it over the weekend.
Week Twelve
This week was spent finishing the AI component and bots and getting the rest of the work that I needed to do a passable standard. Still have not touched the Distributing task which has been a massive mistake.
